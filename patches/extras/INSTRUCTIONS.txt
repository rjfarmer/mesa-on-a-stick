INSTRUCTIONS

Things are a little different to a normal MESA run. There is no need
to ever call ./mk or ./clean (in fact you cant i deleted the
scripts). MESA has already be per-compiled and exists as an
executable installed in a system wide location. This means there is
*NO* support for custom run_stars_extras, if you want to customize
your run_stars_extra file then you will need to use the normal 
installation methods.

To run MESA in this new scheme:
1) Open a terminal by double clicking it
2) Either type
mesa-star-cwd folder_name
or
mesa-star-test test_suite_name folder_name

Where folder_name is the name to save the folder to and
test_suite_name is a name of a MESA test suite folder (in the second case 
you can tap TAB TAB to get a list of possible folders). The
difference between the commands is the mesa-star-cwd creates a copy
of the default work directory, is a basic shell of what you need to
run a model. While mesa-star-test copies a MESA test suite folder, 
which is a useful place to start new projects. 

Then edit the inlists to describe the model you want and then type:
./rn
to start the MESA run. PGSTAR is enabled by default for all runs, 
though you may want to customize the pgstar inlist.
There is also ./re photo_name to restart from a photo. 

In the folder is a sub-folder star-defaults (and binaries have both 
star_defaults and binary-ddefaults) which show the default inlists 
values for parameters you do not set yourself. Editing these files 
will have no effect on the MESA run.

Binary stars can be handled the same way as single stars except replace
mesa-star-cwd with mesa-binary-cwd and
mesa-star-test with mesa-binary-test

There are limitations to what you can run:
No gyre or adipls support
The data files (eos,kap etc) are limited to the default set, so they
can not be changed.
No support for making movies

If people want a customized version (run_stars_extra, 
work directories allready setup, different homepage etc) of this, 
then drop me an email or open a bug report and i can see what i can do.
